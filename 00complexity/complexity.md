complexity refers to the analysis of how efficient an algorithm is in terms of two key factors:

Time Complexity: Measures how the time taken by an algorithm scales with the size of the input.
Space Complexity: Measures how the memory usage of an algorithm scales with the size of the input.git 

1. Time Complexity
Time complexity is expressed using Big-O notation, which describes the upper bound on the time required as a function of the input size (n). The most common types of time complexity are:

Common Types of Time Complexities:
Constant Time – O(1):

The running time does not change with the input size.
Example: Accessing an element in an array by index.
Logarithmic Time – O(log n):

The time increases logarithmically as the input size increases.
Example: Binary search in a sorted array.
Linear Time – O(n):

The time increases directly with the size of the input.
Example: Traversing an array.
Linearithmic Time – O(n log n):

This complexity is often seen in efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.
Example: Sorting a list with Merge Sort.
Quadratic Time – O(n²):

The time increases quadratically as the input size grows.
Example: Nested loops, such as in Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort.
Cubic Time – O(n³):

Similar to quadratic, but with three nested loops.
Example: Matrix multiplication algorithms.
Exponential Time – O(2^n):

The time doubles with each additional element in the input.
Example: Solving problems with brute force, like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Factorial Time – O(n!):

The time grows factorially, which is very slow.
Example: Generating all permutations of a set.

Space Complexity
Space complexity analyzes the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. Like time complexity, it is expressed in Big-O notation.

Types of Space Complexities:
O(1) (Constant Space):

Uses a fixed amount of space, regardless of input size.
Example: Swapping two numbers.
O(n) (Linear Space):

The space required grows linearly with the input size.
Example: Storing an array of n elements.
O(n²) (Quadratic Space):

The space grows quadratically with the input size.
Example: Creating a 2D matrix with n x n elements.
Key Factors in Space Complexity:
Auxiliary Space: Extra space used by the algorithm, excluding the input data.
Input Space: Space taken by the input itself.
Best, Worst, and Average Case Complexity:
Best Case: The minimum time an algorithm takes to complete.
Example: Insertion Sort has a best-case
complexity of O(n) when the input is already sorted.

Worst Case: The maximum time an algorithm could take to complete.

Example: Quick Sort has a worst-case complexity of O(n²) when the pivot selection is poor (e.g., already sorted in reverse).
Average Case: The expected time complexity over all possible inputs.

Example: Quick Sort has an average-case complexity of O(n log n).
Key Concepts Related to Complexity:
Asymptotic Notations: These notations describe the complexity of an algorithm as the input size grows.

Big-O (O): Upper bound (worst-case scenario).
Omega (Ω): Lower bound (best-case scenario).
Theta (Θ): Tight bound (average-case scenario, describing both upper and lower bounds).
Amortized Complexity: This refers to the average time per operation over a sequence of operations, even if some individual operations may be costly.

Example: Dynamic array resizing has an amortized time complexity of O(1) for append operations, even though occasional resizing takes O(n).
Worst-case and Average-case Optimizations:

Algorithms like Quick Sort are designed with a fast average-case time complexity, but data structures like Heaps or Merge Sort are sometimes preferred for worst-case guarantees.
